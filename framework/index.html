            <p>
              As a 25-year-old originally hailing from Iran, my journey into the
              world of technology began during my Bachelor's degree in Software
              Engineering. Currently, I thrive as a Frontend Engineer, driven by a
              genuine passion for architecting and developing web experiences that
              are not only fast and performant but also visually captivating and
              user-friendly. My career has taken me on an exciting seven-year
              adventure, building applications for users across Europe and North
              America. This international experience has now led me to the
              picturesque city of Klagenfurt in Austria, a place I'm happy to call
              home. I find immense satisfaction in dissecting complex challenges and
              transforming them into elegant, intuitive interfaces, leveraging the
              power of modern frameworks and languages like React, Vue, and
              TypeScript. Beyond the lines of code, you'll often find me immersed in
              the ever-evolving landscape of new technologies, constantly seeking
              opportunities to learn and grow. When I step away from the screen, the
              stunning Austrian trails beckon for a hike, offering a refreshing
              contrast to the digital world. Although I find joy in the broader
              spectrum of programming, my core interest has always been deeply
              rooted in the world of games. What began as a childhood hobby has, in
              many ways, steered me towards the aspiration of becoming a game
              engineer. Perhaps one day, I'll even embark on the exciting endeavor
              of establishing my own game production company. And who knows, maybe
              the person reading this brief will be a part of that future!

                  Starting my academic journey at Klagenfurt University was an
                  exciting milestone, but it came with an unexpected challenge. Due
                  to delays in the visa process, I joined the university a month
                  later than planned. The waiting period tested my patience, but it
                  only made my arrival all the more meaningful. Now that I'm
                  officially enrolled in the Game Studies and Engineering program,
                  I'm eager to dive into the world of game design, development, and
                  the technical aspects that shape the industry. Despite the late
                  start, I'm determined to catch up, make connections, and fully
                  embrace this new chapter in my life.
