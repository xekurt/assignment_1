        <h2>Hi there! I'm Ayoub ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>
          As a 25-year-old originally hailing from Iran, my journey into the
          world of technology began during my Bachelor's degree in Software
          Engineering. Currently, I thrive as a Frontend Engineer, driven by a
          genuine passion for architecting and developing web experiences that
          are not only fast and performant but also visually captivating and
          user-friendly. My career has taken me on an exciting seven-year
          adventure, building applications for users across Europe and North
          America. This international experience has now led me to the
          picturesque city of Klagenfurt in Austria, a place I'm happy to call
          home. I find immense satisfaction in dissecting complex challenges and
          transforming them into elegant, intuitive interfaces, leveraging the
          power of modern frameworks and languages like React, Vue, and
          TypeScript. Beyond the lines of code, you'll often find me immersed in
          the ever-evolving landscape of new technologies, constantly seeking
          opportunities to learn and grow. When I step away from the screen, the
          stunning Austrian trails beckon for a hike, offering a refreshing
          contrast to the digital world. Although I find joy in the broader
          spectrum of programming, my core interest has always been deeply
          rooted in the world of games. What began as a childhood hobby has, in
          many ways, steered me towards the aspiration of becoming a game
          engineer. Perhaps one day, I'll even embark on the exciting endeavor
          of establishing my own game production company. And who knows, maybe
          the person reading this brief will be a part of that future!

            <p>
              Starting my academic journey at Klagenfurt University was an
              exciting milestone, but it came with an unexpected challenge. Due
              to delays in the visa process, I joined the university a month
              later than planned. The waiting period tested my patience, but it
              only made my arrival all the more meaningful. Now that Iâ€™m
              officially enrolled in the Game Studies and Engineering program,
              Iâ€™m eager to dive into the world of game design, development, and
              the technical aspects that shape the industry. Despite the late
              start, Iâ€™m determined to catch up, make connections, and fully
              embrace this new chapter in my life.
